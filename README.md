# powerputty

powerputty Go is a collection of general use packages, to help build web
services with Golang.

powerputty is built as a multi-module [workspace](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces).
All packages are appended with `p` to help avoid naming collisions (eg. don't collide with 
stdlib `sql` package, use `sqlp` or "SQL Putty")

I'm also just using it as a central place to keep my learnings and knowledge in a structured place.
